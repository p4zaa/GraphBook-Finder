# GraphBook Finder: Book Finder Website for Bookstore Connected with Graph Database

GraphBook Finder is a web application designed to help users discover books available at the *Chaloklum Bookstore* using a graph database (Neo4j). The website provides an intuitive interface for users to search and explore the vast collection of books, making it easier for them to find their desired titles.

ðŸš§ **Note:** Since this project uses free tier AuraDB Cloud Service it will pause the database after inactive for a while, this will cause the search function to not retrieved any books in the database.
